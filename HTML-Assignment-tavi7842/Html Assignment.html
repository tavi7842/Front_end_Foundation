  <!--Exercise 1.9: Describe any smart phone with image and features by using HTML Tags.-->

  <p>Xiaomi's Redmi Note series has always been popular with consumers, owing to the good value they usually offer. For
    2023, Xiaomi has launched the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G, Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G, and Redmi Note 12 5G. However, unlike
    previous years, these initial three models in the series have gotten much more expensive, with the base model of the
    entry Redmi Note 12 5G starting at Rs. 17,999.</p>
  <p>Today we'll be taking a closer look at the middle child of the series, the Redmi Note 12 5G. The smartphone is
    particularly intriguing as it offers a fresh design and shares a lot of features with the more expensive Redmi Note
    12 Pro+ 5G (Review), making it a good value offering.</p>
  <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/colours_1673878243560.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G">
  <p>The Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G is a good-looking smartphone with pretty decent specs and features. The starting price of
    Rs. 24,999 is not bad, but keep in mind that for a few thousand Rupees more, you can get the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G
    (Review) which starts at Rs. 29,999. This phone offers quicker charging, a higher-resolution primary camera, and
    more storage. However, the Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G should not be ignored as for still offers most of the features and
    specs of the plus model, but at a more affordable price. </p>
